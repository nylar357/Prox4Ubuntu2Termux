Broker
class proxybroker.api.Broker(queue=None, timeout=8, max_conn=200, max_tries=3, judges=None, providers=None, verify_ssl=False, loop=None, **kwargs)[source]
The Broker.

One broker to rule them all, one broker to find them,
One broker to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.
Parameters:	
queue (asyncio.Queue) – (optional) Queue of found/checked proxies
timeout (int) – (optional) Timeout of a request in seconds
max_conn (int) – (optional) The maximum number of concurrent checks of proxies
max_tries (int) – (optional) The maximum number of attempts to check a proxy
judges (list) – (optional) Urls of pages that show HTTP headers and IP address. Or Judge objects
providers (list) – (optional) Urls of pages where to find proxies. Or Provider objects
verify_ssl (bool) – (optional) Flag indicating whether to check the SSL certificates. Set to True to check ssl certifications
loop – (optional) asyncio compatible event loop
Deprecated since version 0.2.0: Use max_conn and max_tries instead of max_concurrent_conn and attempts_conn.

find(*, types=None, data=None, countries=None, post=False, strict=False, dnsbl=None, limit=0, **kwargs)[source]
Gather and check proxies from providers or from a passed data.

Example of usage.

Parameters:	
types (list) – Types (protocols) that need to be check on support by proxy. Supported: HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS4, SOCKS5, CONNECT:80, CONNECT:25 And levels of anonymity (HTTP only): Transparent, Anonymous, High
data – (optional) String or list with proxies. Also can be a file-like object supports read() method. Used instead of providers
countries (list) – (optional) List of ISO country codes where should be located proxies
post (bool) – (optional) Flag indicating use POST instead of GET for requests when checking proxies
strict (bool) – (optional) Flag indicating that anonymity levels of types (protocols) supported by a proxy must be equal to the requested types and levels of anonymity. By default, strict mode is off and for a successful check is enough to satisfy any one of the requested types
dnsbl (list) – (optional) Spam databases for proxy checking. Wiki
limit (int) – (optional) The maximum number of proxies
Raises:	
ValueError – If types not given.

Changed in version 0.2.0: Added: post, strict, dnsbl. Changed: types is required.

grab(*, countries=None, limit=0)[source]
Gather proxies from the providers without checking.

Parameters:	
countries (list) – (optional) List of ISO country codes where should be located proxies
limit (int) – (optional) The maximum number of proxies
Example of usage.

serve(host='127.0.0.1', port=8888, limit=100, **kwargs)[source]
Start a local proxy server.

The server distributes incoming requests to a pool of found proxies.

When the server receives an incoming request, it chooses the optimal proxy (based on the percentage of errors and average response time) and passes to it the incoming request.

In addition to the parameters listed below are also accept all the parameters of the find() method and passed it to gather proxies to a pool.

Example of usage.

Parameters:	
host (str) – (optional) Host of local proxy server
port (int) – (optional) Port of local proxy server
limit (int) – (optional) When will be found a requested number of working proxies, checking of new proxies will be lazily paused. Checking will be resumed if all the found proxies will be discarded in the process of working with them (see max_error_rate, max_resp_time). And will continue until it finds one working proxy and paused again. The default value is 100
max_tries (int) – (optional) The maximum number of attempts to handle an incoming request. If not specified, it will use the value specified during the creation of the Broker object. Attempts can be made with different proxies. The default value is 3
min_req_proxy (int) – (optional) The minimum number of processed requests to estimate the quality of proxy (in accordance with max_error_rate and max_resp_time). The default value is 5
max_error_rate (int) – (optional) The maximum percentage of requests that ended with an error. For example: 0.5 = 50%. If proxy.error_rate exceeds this value, proxy will be removed from the pool. The default value is 0.5
max_resp_time (int) – (optional) The maximum response time in seconds. If proxy.avg_resp_time exceeds this value, proxy will be removed from the pool. The default value is 8
prefer_connect (bool) – (optional) Flag that indicates whether to use the CONNECT method if possible. For example: If is set to True and a proxy supports HTTP proto (GET or POST requests) and CONNECT method, the server will try to use CONNECT method and only after that send the original request. The default value is False
http_allowed_codes (list) – (optional) Acceptable HTTP codes returned by proxy on requests. If a proxy return code, not included in this list, it will be considered as a proxy error, not a wrong/unavailable address. For example, if a proxy will return a 404 Not Found response - this will be considered as an error of a proxy. Checks only for HTTP protocol, HTTPS not supported at the moment. By default the list is empty and the response code is not verified
backlog (int) – (optional) The maximum number of queued connections passed to listen. The default value is 100
Raises:	
ValueError – If limit is less than or equal to zero. Because a parsing of providers will be endless

New in version 0.2.0.

show_stats(verbose=False, **kwargs)[source]
Show statistics on the found proxies.

Useful for debugging, but you can also use if you’re interested.

Parameters:	verbose – Flag indicating whether to print verbose stats
Deprecated since version 0.2.0: Use verbose instead of full.

stop()[source]
Stop all tasks, and the local proxy server if it’s running.

Proxy

classmethod create(host, *args, **kwargs)[source]
Asynchronously create a Proxy object.

Parameters:	
host (str) – A passed host can be a domain or IP address. If the host is a domain, try to resolve it
